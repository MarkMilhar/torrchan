**How to Use the Crypto Key Derivation Tool**

This tool helps you generate cryptographic data for secure communication and content verification, particularly useful for announcing torrents or other digital content.

**1. Input Your Data:**

* **Public Key:** Paste your SSH public key (e.g., `ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC...`) into this field. This key is used to establish your unique `CHANNEL`.
* **Issue Number:** Enter an integer representing the current issue or version number of your content. This number, along with your public key and password, helps derive a unique `TAG` for this specific issue.
* **Password:** Provide a strong password. This is crucial for the security of your `TAG` derivation.
* **Root (Optional Torrent Hash):** If your content is part of a larger chain or has a preceding torrent, you can enter its hash here. This field is optional and does not affect the core cryptographic calculations in this tool.

**2. Generate Keys:**

* Click the "Generate Keys" button. The tool will perform the cryptographic calculations and display the results in the "Combined Issue Data" section.

**3. Interpret the Output (Combined Issue Data):**

The output will be a single JSON object with two main sections: `current` and `next`.

* **`current` Section:** This contains the cryptographic values for the `Issue Number` you entered.
    * `CHANNEL`: The SHA256 hash of your public key. This uniquely identifies your cryptographic channel.
    * `TAG`: A pseudo-random key derived from your `CHANNEL`, `Issue Number`, and `Password` using a strong Key Derivation Function (PBKDF2).
    * `CHECK_A`: A randomly generated 256-bit number.
    * `CHECK_B`: Another randomly generated 256-bit number.
    * `CHECK_C`: The SHA256 hash of `TAG` XORed with `CHECK_A` and `CHECK_B`. This acts as a verifiable proof.
    * `TORRENT_NAME`: This field provides the suggested name for your current torrent: `<CHANNEL> <TAG>`.

* **`next` Section:** This contains the cryptographic values for `Issue Number + 1`.
    * It includes `CHANNEL`, `TAG`, `CHECK_A`, and `CHECK_C`, similar to the `current` section.
    * **Important:** `CHECK_B` is deliberately *omitted* from the `next` section. This is part of the verification mechanism for your future posts.
    * `TORRENT_NAME`: The suggested name for your *next* torrent: `<CHANNEL> <TAG>` (for `Issue + 1`).

**4. Create Your Torrent (Current Post):**

* **Torrent Name:** Use the `TORRENT_NAME` value from the `current` section (e.g., `abcdef... 123456...`).
* **Torrent Content:** The torrent should contain a file (e.g., `data.json`) which holds the *entire combined JSON output* generated by this tool. This file includes both the `current` and `next` sections.

**5. Announce Your Next Post (Future Verification):**

When you create your next post (for `Issue + 1`), you will use the `CHANNEL` and `TAG` values from the `next` section of your *previously generated* JSON. In the description or an accompanying file for that new torrent, include the following message:

"My next post `[Your Issue Number + 1]` will be available in the torrent network with name `[TORRENT_NAME from the 'next' section of your previous output, e.g., CHANNEL TAG]`. In order to verify that this information is authentic, the torrent will contain all solution for `CHECK_C = SHA256(TAG ^ CHECK_A ^ X)`, where `X` is `CHECK_B`, missing in this announce."

This message tells others that the `CHECK_B` value (which was missing in the `next` section of your *previous* output) will be revealed in the `Issue + 1` torrent, allowing them to verify `CHECK_C` and confirm the authenticity of your new post.
